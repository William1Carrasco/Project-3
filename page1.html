  <article>
    <h>These images explain how we call different pileus' and stipes as well what
      the different spore-bearing surfaces look like. Take a moment to study these
      images and try to recall what similarities you see from the mushrooms on the
      previous page. Color is also very important to note because mushrooms of all
      different colors and shades have the similar pileus' and stipes. Knowing what
      habitat a given edible mushroom grows in, you can target a good area to hunt
      for it. For example some mushrooms grow off certain species of trees, whiles
      others grow off the mulch of leaves. If you collect a sample take
      its spore print so you can reference it later. After collecting all the discriptive
      characteristics of a specific sample, you want to refer to an identification
      book. Identification books are organized to help you use the characteristics
      you find to guide you to possible mushrooms, elimation ones along the way.</h>
    <h>On the next pages you will see pictures of mushrooms. Use what you've learned
      to figure out which description best describes the mushroom from the 4 choices.</h>
    <h>Good luck!</h>
