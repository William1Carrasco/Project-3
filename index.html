    <h>How to Identify Mushrooms</h>
  </header>
    <h>These are some of the common edible mushrooms that grow in California. Notice
      how the different mushrooms look compared to each other, and the feature they
      share and don't. 5 basic characteristics that are used to identify mushrooms are;
      the shape and color of their pileus(the cap or top portion of the mushroom);
      the length, thickness and color of their stipe(the stem or lower portion of the
      mushroom); the color of their spores(found by cutting the mushroom at the top
      of the stipe and placing the pileus bottom side down on white paper for a few
      hours); and the habitat in which it grew. With this information someone can
      narrow down the possible species of a mushroom they observed or collected sample.
    <h>In this basic mushroom guide you will learn how to correctly identify the
      different characteristics of mushrooms. Then you'll be quized to see if you
      can figure out what species a mushroom belongs to from an option of different
      descriptions. If you are incorrect you will get feed back on way that answer
      is not correct.
